# hwLedger

[![AI Slop Inside](https://sladge.net/badge.svg)](https://sladge.net)

_LLM capacity planner + fleet ledger + desktop inference runtime._

**Not a financial ledger.** hwLedger tracks hardware fleet audit and provenance for machine learning workloads. It provides per-layer VRAM estimation for LLMs, reconciles predictions against live telemetry from inference engines (MLX, mistral.rs, llama.cpp, vLLM, TGI), and maintains an event-sourced audit log for heterogeneous compute fleets (Apple Silicon, NVIDIA/AMD, cloud rentals).

**Status:** pre-alpha, Phase 0 bootstrap. See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for the implementation roadmap.

hwLedger is an Apache-2.0 desktop app + agent/server pair that:

1. **Plans** VRAM and throughput for any HF / GGUF / MLX / Ollama model, correctly handling dense, MoE, MLA, GQA, sliding-window, SSM/Mamba, and hybrid-attention architectures — with a slider UX over a live per-layer breakdown.
2. **Reconciles** predictions against live telemetry from MLX, mistral.rs, llama.cpp, vLLM, or TGI.
3. **Runs** inference locally on Apple Silicon via a forked oMlx sidecar with SSD-paged KV cache.
4. **Ledgers** a heterogeneous fleet — local NVIDIA/AMD boxes, Apple Silicon laptops, cheap cloud rentals (Vast.ai, RunPod, Lambda) — with a shared event-sourced audit log, dispatch planner, and spot-price-aware cost model.
5. Ships as **per-OS native GUIs** (SwiftUI / WinUI 3 / Qt 6 + Slint) over a shared Rust FFI core.

> _A hobbyist-sized fleet with enterprise bones._

## Quickstart

**Install the CLI from source** — this is the fastest path to a working hwLedger today:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/hwledger-cli
hwledger --help
```

**Web fallback (no compilation needed):** A Streamlit web interface is available at [`apps/streamlit/`](./apps/streamlit/) — run `cargo run -p hwledger-devtools -- up` to launch it locally on `localhost:8501` along with the API server.

> **macOS DMG note:** Native macOS DMG distribution is currently blocked on Apple Developer certificate renewal — see [WP21 Apple Developer secrets](./docs/reports/WP21-APPLE-DEV-SECRETS.md) for setup instructions. Use the Streamlit fallback or CLI above for now.

## Why

Every existing public VRAM calculator (HF Accelerate, can-it-run-llm, LM Studio's gauge) gets MoE and MLA wrong — they under-count KV cache and over-count MoE throughput. hwLedger's math core is architecture-keyed: it dispatches per `AttentionKind` (MHA / GQA / MQA / MLA / Sliding / SSM / Hybrid / Sink) and treats resident-vs-active parameters separately for MoE. See [PLAN.md §5](./PLAN.md#5-math-core-51-is-the-products-soul).

## Architecture

- **Core**: Rust workspace (`hwledger-core`, `-arch`, `-ingest`, `-probe`, `-inference`, `-ledger`, `-fleet-proto`, `-agent`, `-server`, `-cli`, `-ffi`)
- **Sidecar**: `sidecars/omlx-fork/` — fat fork of [jundot/omlx](https://github.com/jundot/omlx), Apache-2.0
- **Native apps**: `apps/macos/` (SwiftUI + UniFFI + XCFramework), `apps/windows/` (WinUI 3 + .NET 9 + csbindgen), `apps/linux-qt/` (Qt 6 + cxx-qt + QML), `apps/linux-slint/` (Rust-native)
- **Fleet wire**: Axum + rustls mTLS for agents; russh + deadpool for SSH agentless; reqwest for Vast/RunPod/Lambda/Modal; `tailscale status --json` for tailnet discovery

See the component diagram in [PLAN.md §4.1](./PLAN.md#41-component-map).

## Dev setup

One-liner to build FFI + launch server, docs-site, and Streamlit:

```bash
cargo run -p hwledger-devtools -- up
```

See [docs-site/getting-started/dev-setup.md](./docs-site/getting-started/dev-setup.md) for ports, log locations, and troubleshooting (FFI auto-build, Swift "engine missing" sheet, streamlit hot-reload).
